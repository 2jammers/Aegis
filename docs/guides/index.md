# Introduction
Aegis is a simple strictly-typed UI framework which is specifically made for Roblox! Aegis always keeps in mind about performance and the ease of syntax usage. There are almost no complicated or extra stuff added so you never have to worry about complication!

It is not only simple on the API surface, but also internally, meaning you can update the internals however you like without any issues!

# Comparison
### Roact / React VS Aegis
Starting to work with roact is extremely difficult for a beginner. Not only that, but the internals are very complicated, way too many scripts and too much work for a single feature.

Aegis is nothing like that! The internals are built in such a way that there's absolutely no extra work for a single feature, rather it completes a single feature in small amount of code or in the smallest and most performant way possible. When you try to change any internals in Roact, you'd have to change quite a few stuff, however in Aegis, you just have to change a few lines of code!

Even on the API surface, you don't have to be an intermediate in UI/UX development, you just have to know the basics of scripting and UI development and you're done!

### Fusion VS Aegis
The syntax of Aegis is inspired from Fusion but you might say, "What's the problem with Fusion? It's so much more simpler than Fusion!"
The most common problem of it is not the external API surface, rather the internals and the continuous code change. The internals are very complicated for a person who might want to change a few stuff here and there in the code. And for those who don't want to change anything, you'd still have to deal with the changes that Fusion keeps coming up with.

Aegis tries its best to keep the codebase consistent so that there's almost no tough decisions for the users while developing about what to do if they were to switch over to a newer version!
